## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
US <- subset(Carseats, US == "Yes")
mean(US$Sales)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
Carseats %>%
  group_by(US)%>%
  summarize(Means = mean(Sales), SD = sd(Sales), n = n())
```

```{r}
hist(US$Sales)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = Carseats, aes(x = Sales)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(.~US) + 
  theme_bw()
```

aes stands for aesthetic. mapping sales to sample.
geom says what do we want to do with that mapping? qq plot, above histogram
facet grid is whether side by side or one on top of the other

```{r}
ggplot(data = Carseats, aes(sample = Sales)) +
  geom_qq(color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_grid(US~.)
```

```{r}
UCL <- mean(US$Sales) + 1.96 * (sd(US$Sales)/length(US$Sales))
UCL
```

can pull out just the confidence interval from the t.test

```{r}
#t.test(Sales ~ US, data = Carseats)
CI <- t.test(Sales ~ US, data = Carseats)$conf
CI
```

The 95\% CI is $(`r CI[1]`, `r CI[2]`)$
above is a way to type r code into document
